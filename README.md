# Predicting One-Year Recovery Outcomes in Psychosis: Machine Learning on Real-World Clinical Data

In this github repository you can find all code necessary to recreate our study or to just take a look at what we have done. There are a few things that need further instruction:
First of all, the code can be found by first opening the project in Rstudio (opening "Blaauw_thesis.Rproj"). After opening the project, it is important to first install the library reticulate, which makes it possible to use python libraries in R. This can be done by opening "Reticulate_install.Rmd" and following the steps. This should not be simple, but when in trouble multiple guides can be found on the internet to help. Now you are ready to open "Main.Rmd", which consists of all code written during the project. When running the code, you will be asked to type in a password. This is because the data contains private information about patients and is thus encrypted. As of now, the dataset is private and password is shared only by persons working on this project or projects with the same data at.
After filling in the password, the code can be runned. It is important to install libraries that are not yet installed on your computer.
